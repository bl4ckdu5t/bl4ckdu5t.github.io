The design of this blog was solely done by Joseph Rex using front-end technologies including HTML5, CSS3, Sass, and JavaScript. I'm putting together a styleguide which will be linked from here soon. The site runs under a Jekyll platform and hosted by Github. If you will like a printed version of the blog posts, I've styled the print media to produce good print versions.

The inscribed name at the top "Joseph Rex" was inspired by [Dessy Chongarova][1]'s [blog][2].

The design layout of the blog was inspired by [Aur√©lien SALOMON][7]'s future [Wikipedia design concept][8] on behance.

I use the Open Sans font provided by [Google fonts][3], [Google Analytics][4] and [Hotjar][9] for monitoring the site usage.

I thought of creating this colophon after coming across [Richard Rutter][5]'s [colophon][6].
