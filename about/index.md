I am <span itemprop="name">Joseph Rex</span> (<span itemprop="nickname">bl4ckdu5t</span>). I love to build things, break things, and fix 'em. I have a strong passion for usability. Since I read [The design of everyday things][4] by [Don Norman][6], I got a different view on usability and I've since worked hard on creating human centered designs. This has influenced how I design software and applications with good user experience. I am fullstack developer with a focus on Ruby and JavaScript. I've built most applications using Sinatra and <span itemprop="title">Ruby-on-Rails</span>. I preach and practice TDD, now taking a leap into BDD. I play with python and clojure for mini projects in my free time. I've built desktop GUI software  like [this][7] with PyQt(the python wrapper for Qt4). I'm considering [electron](http://electron.atom.io/) for future GUI projects.

I love math and vector graphics. I use [mathML][1] and [SVG][15] and I sometimes take out time to design [amateur graphics][14].

<span itemprop="url">[StrichIO][5]</span> is my portfolio website, I have some front-end experiments on [codepen][8], projects on [github][9], [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/bl4ckdu5t), and on [bitbucket][10]. I sporadically smash my rants on [twitter][11], I'm a member of [dc414][12], and I write on security for [Infosec Institute][13].

Unarguably, I spend a lot of time with my computer but when I'm not on it, I play basketball or watch movies.

There's more [about me][16]. The image I use all over the internet was originally designed by [Funkwood][17] on [Deviantart][18].
