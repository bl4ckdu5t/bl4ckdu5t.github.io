The common saying is &amp;ldquo;The walls have ears&amp;rdquo;. This is a figurative expression that expresses that things we say can be heard by people around even while we think there&amp;rsquo;s no one around (or information just leaks in one way or another). Technology in this generation has caused a lot of transformations and changed the way we see things.

Everyone that comes around me notices that I always emphasize on building stuff for the future. I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with start-ups and I&amp;rsquo;m working with one. I love the fact that involving in most of the projects I&amp;rsquo;ve contributed to has built my development skills. What I&amp;rsquo;m not satisfied with is that we keep iterating development of pre-existing solutions. I believe programming and hackery is about providing solutions that do not exist to problems that are pending.</description>
