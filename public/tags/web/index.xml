&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve seen different front-end developers start their projects. In most cases for intermediate designers, first steps are to write the basic HTML, download &lt;a href=&#34;http://getbootstrap.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;bootstrap&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://foundation.zurb.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;foundation&lt;/a&gt; framework for local use, download an icon-font set like &lt;a href=&#34;http://fontawesome.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;fontawesome&lt;/a&gt;, and they start writing their mark-up to fit the styles defined by the framework.

      <title>Prioritizing Critical (Above the fold) CSS to optimize page load speed</title>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made &lt;a href=&#34;http://slides.com/bl4ckdu5t/critical-css&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;a slide&lt;/a&gt; on this about a month back and I&amp;rsquo;ve since intended to write about it here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every developer that cares about user experience will always want to fix everything that makes a user think of not coming back to their website after first visit. I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself in such situations where I begin to think that whoever did this thing must have invested a lot of time making something that technically feels like nothing. We don&amp;rsquo;t want our applications to be thought of this way.

      <title>Good son, bad father: I&#39;m leaving PHP but I love Laravel</title>

&lt;p&gt;PHP has a really shallow learning curve. It&amp;rsquo;s easy for a 8 year old to pick it up and start messing around with it. This is good and I love it about Python as well. However, PHP has been known to have a lot of flaws, one of the major reasons being because it was not built as a functional programming language but rather, just a Hypertext pre-processor. It was meant to just automate the behaviour of HTML. Around 2005, OOP was introduced to PHP and it made PHP developers feel among the big boys of the web.

Thanks to collaborated projects, I&amp;rsquo;ve come across crappy CSS in my life. I talked about it in a [previous article][1].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not impeccable and I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be dissing someone else&amp;rsquo; because of their faults. However, one point I failed to mention about what I experienced from a co-designer on the project I mentioned in that article was the use of too many nested selectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nested selectors increase specificity and they should be avoided when they can. In an instance where you have

      <title>Collaborated Projects are good and bad</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Project collaboration is one of the greatest things ever, especially in the open source community. Despite it&amp;rsquo;s awesomeness, there are always challenges in collaborated projects. Some idealist programmers pick up the code and find it uncomfortable to mix with non coordinated contributions by a clumsy programmer. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.php-fig.org/psr/&#34;&gt;PSR&lt;/a&gt; exists in the PHP community to bring about ideas that may make good programmers follow some good concepts. This way, you&amp;rsquo;ll find a lot of similarity in the codes of various programmers that follow the PSR.

      <title>Sass and Compass: My Best Friends</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a left-brained computer savvy. I love logic and math and because of this, I may be attracted to Sass not just because it&amp;rsquo;s awesome but also because it gives me a chance to keep my brain busy with logic. I think this picture speaks my state of mind right now&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{% image sass-tshirt-1.jpg alt=&amp;ldquo;sass-tshirt-1&amp;rdquo; class=&amp;ldquo;head-image&amp;rdquo; %}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing Sass for 3 months now. I hope to give Stylus a try some time soon as I hear of it as another Super Hero Pre-processor. As of now, I don&amp;rsquo;t have any interest in writing LESS. This article is not about what I like or what I don&amp;rsquo;t like anyway.

      <title>.attr() is not what you want, use .prop()</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;JavaScript is boss at what it does by helping us manipulate the DOM. jQuery has helped JS starters and also PROs that want to get work done in time. The .attr() function is meant to get the attributes of a selected node in the DOM. Starting with jQuery, I felt it was totally ok to use .attr() not just because it was the function I felt I wanted, but it sounded semantically ok with the task I want to achieve. Thinking of it in a simple way, &amp;ldquo;attr&amp;rdquo; looks like an abbreviation of &amp;ldquo;attribute&amp;rdquo; and what I want to do is access the contents of my HTML element attribute. Used it like this for a while and found out it didn&amp;rsquo;t work as perfect as I expected till I discovered I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been doing it this way. .attr() accesses defaultValue (initial value) of an element&amp;rsquo;s attribute which means if I have a mark-up like this

      <title>Future of CSS: Content Pseudo Selector</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before I started making use of CSS3 to create beautiful websites, I had crappy ways of getting some things done which I think some other designers also did. Since the introduction of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/&#34;&gt;CSS3 pseudo selectors&lt;/a&gt;, my life got  better. They helped me achieve decent mark-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately, I thought of making my life a lot easier by doing something even more awesome. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it exists already or in the works, but I&amp;rsquo;ll go into details on how I came about it and I think it will be really cool.

      <title>CSS Sanitation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I do a lot of back-end web development but front-end calls me a lot because of my passion for creativity. I&amp;rsquo;ve had to consider CSS files on various projects I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on. Some as front-end designer, some as back-end. On a project I&amp;rsquo;m working on, we&amp;rsquo;ve had various hands in the stylesheets and it has caused a lot of irrelevant rules in the CSS. Some global classes are not really been put to use and the CSS already contains over 6,500 lines of code already. Also, the fact that multiple frameworks are used on the present project, it lands us in a larger number of selectors.

      <title>Oh Sass! How awesome is it gonna get</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started writing Sass not too long ago and it has been one of the best experiences I&amp;rsquo;ve had. Sass (Syntatically Awesome Stylesheet) is just as awesome as the name sounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sass is a CSS predecessor that gives smart designers a lot more flexibility with the styling. New features are being added to Sass and with contributions of the Google team, it&amp;rsquo;s getting even faster than you can imagine. This &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZJeOJGazgE&#34;&gt;talk by Chris Eppstein&lt;/a&gt; reveals the work in progress.
