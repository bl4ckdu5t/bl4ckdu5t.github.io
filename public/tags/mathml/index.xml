      <title>Algorithm Analysis: Best, Worst and Average Case</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Algorithms are a sequence of decisions we make to solve a problem. Like every decision in life we can make great decisions and really terrible decisions. But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t end there. Good decisions vary, they can come easy and can take a lot harder process to reach an expected outcome.

There are 3 categories of efficiency an algorithm can fall under when analyzing its usage of resources. They are best case, worst case, and average case.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;For a while, I&amp;rsquo;ve been enjoying the awesomeness of mathML. I&amp;rsquo;ve not had specific use cases but just playing around with it gives me fun. Sometimes I idly just write equations that should be on a paper in my local web pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a lot you can learn about MathML by looking through the MDN spec. I&amp;rsquo;ll just drop in the little parts I&amp;rsquo;ve played. This has been for so many years and it still available but it is only supported by gecko browsers (Mozilla Firefox, Iceweasel, some others) .
