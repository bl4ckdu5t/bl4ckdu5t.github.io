I&#8217;ve been a Debian user for some time. I started using Debian since squeeze was<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianStable" target="_blank"> DebianStable</a>Â . Debian is a great OS and so many interesting operating systems have been built from its kernel.

I used to be an Ubuntu user till I got fed up of Unity and I never tried Kubuntu, Xubuntu, or Gnome in Ubuntu. Switching to Debian wasn&#8217;t a bad idea because I recently realized we are life partners.

I&#8217;ve been occupied with tasks from freelance jobs and the start-up I work with. This has taken away my day and my night and made me a really weird being. Well, it&#8217;s one of the things you get that makes you a &#8220;Forever Alone&#8221; guy. These things have made me stray from my actual passion which includes computer security and data Forensics.

I chose to take back my passion from my busy life by installing an awesome pentest OS into my box so I could take some time out to do some hacks. I haven&#8217;t messed around with networks, used tools like SET, Metasploit, Armitage, and Maltego for almost a year. But Nmap is stuck with me. Which security enthusiast/expert does not use Nmap in his daily life? It&#8217;s just inevitable.

I searched through my list of many OS ISOs in my external HDD and found Matriux Ec-centric which I had <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3hdPlzXJdU" target="_blank">made a video on</a> a year ago.

Thought I&#8217;d give it a try so I started backing-up my data and then I moved on to Matriux. Switching my operating system was like going through a divorce as it took over a week to get over with it. I love Debian but Matriux is like a beautiful Australlian blonde that came into my life.

You know one thing about marriage? It&#8217;s never a good thing to get a divorce. I got a divorce with Debian anyway <img src="http://josephrex.me/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" /> and after a week with Matriux, I discovered Matriux Ec-Centric was built from <a href="https://www.debian.org/News/2014/20140424" target="_blank">Debian Squeeze which is only on LTS (Long Term Support) </a>now and has lost full support.

There was a lot of weird things like the Kernel version on the Matriux appeared to be 3.3.* and from what I hear, that&#8217;s not a stable Kernel. Debian Wheezy still uses 3.2. I love Matriux for it&#8217;s tools but I don&#8217;t know how it was built and I can&#8217;t rely fully on it because of my work. Besides, I couldn&#8217;t get my WLAN drivers to work even after installing a firmware for my Broadcom Driver.

Like a real man, I took the courage to go back to the wife I had divorced. These blondes are never good enough as wives. They only rule the strip clubs <img src="http://josephrex.me/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" /> (don&#8217;t take me serious, I still love blondes and will like one as a wife).

Since 2 weeks ago, I&#8217;ve been back on my Debian Wheezy but no more on Gnome desktop like I used to be. I&#8217;m rocking KDE. People may say it&#8217;s heavy and stuff but Gnome is heavy as well and I don&#8217;t care. It doesn&#8217;t even freeze like my Gnome desktop used to.

Oh! What about my computer security thingy! I&#8217;ve started downloading the ones I need manually so I prefer peace of mind + a stable life to an arsenal of pentest tools and headaches.
