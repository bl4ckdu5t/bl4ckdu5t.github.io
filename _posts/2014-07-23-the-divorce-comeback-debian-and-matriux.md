I've been a Debian user for some time. I started using Debian since squeeze was<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianStable" target="_blank"> DebianStable</a>Â . Debian is a great OS and so many interesting operating systems have been built from its kernel.

I used to be an Ubuntu user till I got fed up of Unity and I never tried Kubuntu, Xubuntu, or Gnome in Ubuntu. Switching to Debian wasn't a bad idea because I recently realized we are life partners.

I've been occupied with tasks from freelance jobs and the start-up I work with. This has taken away my day and my night and made me a really weird being. Well, it's one of the things you get that makes you a "Forever Alone" guy. These things have made me stray from my actual passion which includes computer security and data Forensics.

I chose to take back my passion from my busy life by installing an awesome pentest OS into my box so I could take some time out to do some hacks. I haven't messed around with networks, used tools like SET, Metasploit, Armitage, and Maltego for almost a year. But Nmap is stuck with me. Which security enthusiast/expert does not use Nmap in his daily life? It's just inevitable.

I searched through my list of many OS ISOs in my external HDD and found Matriux Ec-centric which I had <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3hdPlzXJdU" target="_blank">made a video on</a> a year ago.

Thought I'd give it a try so I started backing-up my data and then I moved on to Matriux. Switching my operating system was like going through a divorce as it took over a week to get over with it. I love Debian but Matriux is like a beautiful Australlian blonde that came into my life.

You know one thing about marriage? It's never a good thing to get a divorce. I got a divorce with Debian anyway :( . After a week with Matriux, I discovered Matriux Ec-Centric was built from <a href="https://www.debian.org/News/2014/20140424" target="_blank">Debian Squeeze which is only on LTS (Long Term Support) </a>now and has lost full support.

There was a lot of weird things like the Kernel version on the Matriux appeared to be 3.3.* and from what I hear, that's not a stable Kernel. Debian Wheezy still uses 3.2. I love Matriux for it's tools but I don't know how it was built and I can't rely fully on it because of my work. Besides, I couldn't get my WLAN drivers to work even after installing a firmware for my Broadcom Driver.

Like a real man, I took the courage to go back to the wife I had divorced. These blondes are never good enough as wives. They only rule the strip clubs :D (don't take me serious, I still love blondes and will like one as a wife).

Since 2 weeks ago, I've been back on my Debian Wheezy but no more on Gnome desktop like I used to be. I'm rocking KDE. People may say it's heavy and stuff but Gnome is heavy as well and I don't care. It doesn't even freeze like my Gnome desktop used to.

Oh! What about my computer security thingy! I've started downloading the ones I need manually so I prefer peace of mind + a stable life to an arsenal of pentest tools and headaches.
