I get people telling me I do really crappy stuffs when I&#8217;m idle, one of the reasons being because I built a girlfriend program because I&#8217;m a nerd and I&#8217;m forever alone.

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-107" src="http://josephrex.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/forever_alone.gif" alt="forever_alone" width="300" height="169" />][1]

Well that&#8217;s true, I could be crazy but not as much as the guys who invented this language [ArnoldC][2].

I think the whole world should appreciate idleness because it makes us come up with some ideas we wouldn&#8217;t come up with on regular basis.

The ArnoldC language is really awesome and fascinating as it uses favorite quotes of the famous actor Arnold Shwarzenegger.

You can see some of those quotes in this video:



The language is so easy and interesting. An Hello World program in it is like so:

&nbsp;

<pre class="lang:default decode:true">IT'S SHOWTIME
TALK TO THE HAND "hello world"
YOU HAVE BEEN TERMINATED</pre>

and it uses a &#8220;.arnoldc&#8221; extension. I&#8217;ve not known how useful it may be in real life applications but I really love it and I&#8217;ll love to be a part of it.

Here&#8217;s [the project on github][3]
