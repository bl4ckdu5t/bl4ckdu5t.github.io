An alistapart article by Matt Griffin. It&#8217;s always a big challenge especially for starter web designers and developers to put a price to what they do. Sometimes clients take advantage of this to make you do great work for ridiculously less prices. Then one day you get bigger and ask yourself if you really did the same things you are doing now back then and you look at the payment difference. For those that have already been getting well paid, this also puts you through some pros and cons on some of the web pricing methods.
