We are all humans and appreciations are rewards that gladdens anyone. Some developers live a totally normal life. Especially those that have grown to build a family and have to keep them with love. On the other hand, there are a lot more melancholic developers that only find peace by dealing with complex logic. If a developer contributes to your project, start-up, firm, it shouldn&#8217;t matter if they are still contributing or not. In cases of open source projects contributions, even if you didn&#8217;t accept their pull requests and didn&#8217;t take their changes, the attempt is worth appreciating.
