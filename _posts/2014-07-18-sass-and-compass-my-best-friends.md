I&#8217;m a left-brained computer savvy. I love logic and math and because of this, [I may be attracted to Sass][1] not just because it&#8217;s awesome but also because it gives me a chance to keep my brain busy with logic. I think this picture speaks my state of mind right now

I&#8217;ve been writing Sass for 3 months now. I hope to give Stylus a try some time soon as I hear of it as another Super Hero Pre-processor. As of now, I don&#8217;t have any interest in writing LESS. This article is not about what I like or what I don&#8217;t like anyway.

In my first month of writing Sass, I wrote all my Sass files and compiled with the Sass binary this way

> sass &#8211;watch &#8211;update file.sass

It was awesome because I had started experiencing the use of the awesome syntax but I was going through the stress of running that compile process after every change I made. Being a restless developer, I stumbled upon <a href="http://compass-style.org" target="_blank">compass</a>.

Remember how lovers say &#8220;Meeting you was the best thing that ever happened to me&#8221; ? This was how it was with me and compass. Compass could auto-compile my sass files while I save them. Not only did compass provide this auto-compile feature, it also provides <a href="http://compass-style.org/frameworks/" target="_blank">frameworks</a> to help me kick-start my front-end projects. Oh awesome!!! **Write Sass once and you&#8217;ll never go back to vanilla CSS**.

Wanna know what it&#8217;s like using compass. Words can&#8217;t explain, this does it:

It would be totally not nice for me to eulogize compass this way and not give some references to where you can find awesome resources and tutorials on it.

Conclusion:

Sass and Compass have a great way of helping you write very useful and flexible styles. The Ruby config even allows you to specify the CSS output style which can be minified (compressed), nested, and more.
