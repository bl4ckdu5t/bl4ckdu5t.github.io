As the web grows, different design trends come into existence. A larger number of organizations will focus more on keeping to this trends, having a nice website that is responsive, having something with cool Javascript effects.

There's a lot more things that make your website suck and one I can say is your perspective about your website. It's not cool to everyone just because it seems cool to you and your colleagues. You should read <a href="http://www.webpagesthatsuck.com/biggest-mistakes-in-web-design-1995-2015.html" target="_blank">the biggest mistakes in web design</a>.

UX is essential, you must consider it from the very start of your projects. From your browser level, you can run as much tests as you want. You can run audits, monitor your network waterfall, test for various viewports and media types. There are also services that help around the web like:

Understanding the<a href="http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2012/02/10/the-performance-golden-rule/" target="_blank"> 80/20 principle</a> can make you get an idea of what you are doing if you don't already know this. Sadly, most of the web performance solutions have been since the mid 2000s and I still see a lot of start-ups flaw at not putting these things to consideration.

If you're on a Mac, you should have codekit. I've giving it a spin in my OS X vm and it's what every web developer needs. Moving to rails was one of the best decisions I'll ever make in my life as it is a framework that doesn't just consider delivering a product but it helps you put a great UX into consideration from the start. The <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html" target="_blank">assets pipeline</a> is just so great the way it works as it handles minification, concatenation of files, and caching. Server side configurations like <a href="https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs" target="_blank">html5boilerplate's solutions for various server</a> software can come in handy too. Some years back <a href="https://twitter.com/chriscoyier" target="_blank">Chris Coyier</a> made a video on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQKVtAMyiG0" target="_blank">speeding up websites</a> and I find that usefult till date. If you're just an entrepreneur and you want to build that app for revenue and you don't know all the technical details, either you find someone that prioritize these things to do the job or make sure the developers you have do not skip these things.

Your business is useless if it doesn't satisfy its users. <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/users-dont-care-about-you/" target="_blank">Your users do not care about you</a>, they do not care about your website, they are only on your website for the goodies. Give it to them and they'll give you want.

A good website requires good content, something that keeps the users, proper performance, a good interface. There are a lot of web builders that talk on performance, tools on performance.<a href="http://perf.rocks" target="_blank"> Perf.rocks</a> keeps a list of them all.
