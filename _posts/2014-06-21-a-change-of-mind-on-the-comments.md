In an [earlier article,][1] I was whining about leaving WordPress and keeping my comments disabled. It&#8217;s not been too long since that article and I already have my mind changed. Well, you may say I change my mind like a girl change her clothes.

I always had <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/" target="_blank">Akismet</a> in my plugins list but I never really valued it until now. After seeking for some solutions to my issues with spammers, I saw I had the key to sesame in my pocket all along.

Akismet is a really awesome wordpress plugin for handling spam comments. If you had found yourself in the same situation as I was, you should get Akismet. I think I should get some money for advertising them. Crazy part is that I have a friend that works at Auttomatic and I never taught of asking her if they had solutions to this.

Anyway, it&#8217;s fixed. Welcome back comments!!!
