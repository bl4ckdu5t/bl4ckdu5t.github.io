I've gotten to do a lot of things besides writing codes. I once took a job as a graphic designer and then I made vector graphics for ads. Here's one of what I did in my free.

I love good designs, graphics, and creativity. I've been an artist from my childhood and I haven't dropped it till date. I only happen to be more of a code artist these days.

Motion graphics is way beyond my vector illustration up there. I once dived into it but I was too busy with other things to cling on to it. I did a few works (3 maybe) with After Effects.

Since I'm no god and I can't do all things even as I like them, I feel it will be nice to talk about something I like.

I'm crushing on VFX (Visual Effects), CGI (Computer Generated Imagery), FUI (Fictional User Interfaces), and I always look up to the works of <a href="http://deccadigital.com/about/" target="_blank">Corey Bramall</a> who did the effects in popular movies like:

  * G.I Joe: Retaliation
  * Captain America: The Winter Soldier
  * Transformers: Age of extinction
  * Iron Man 3

He talked about how he used Yanobox Nodes with After Effects  in the making of Transformers <a href="http://fxfactory.com/blog/after-effects/nodes-used-in-transformers-age-of-extinction/" target="_blank">here</a>

Going through his works just makes me think of how much I want someone into this to be around me. A friend or a relative. Sadly, no one is getting creative enough to go into that.

I may never be a VFX designer but I'll always admire does who do it well, and appreciate their works.

If you're into motion graphics, then I admire you and I hope you keep doing what you're doing. :)
