Before I say anything further, I must say I believe in this saying

> No Internet, No Life

Although, you may see me posting memes like this in some places:[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-35" src="http://josephrex.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/hB9B3DEE9.jpeg" alt="Enough internet for today" width="492" height="496" />][1]When I say that, I don&#8217;t really mean it :p . I only say that when I see stuffs like what I have below

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-36" src="http://josephrex.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/And-Thats-Enough-Internet-For-One-Day-I-Think.jpg" alt="And-Thats-Enough-Internet-For-One-Day-I-Think" width="600" height="455" />][2][<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37" src="http://josephrex.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/a5eme3O_700b.jpg" alt="a5eme3O_700b" width="600" height="521" />][3][<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-38" src="http://josephrex.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/aGYXX7z_460s.jpg" alt="aGYXX7z_460s" width="460" height="417" />][4][<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-39" src="http://josephrex.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/images.jpeg" alt="images" width="194" height="260" />][5][<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40" src="http://josephrex.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/imageffs.jpeg" alt="imageffs" width="225" height="225" />][6]So you see that&#8217;s worth it right. But really, even at midnight when I&#8217;m to be sleeping, I&#8217;m like

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41" src="http://josephrex.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/one-more-click.jpg" alt="one-more-click" width="499" height="399" />][7]If you have no sense of humor, you shouldn&#8217;t be on this website till this line. <img src="http://josephrex.me/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> for those of you that are still here, let&#8217;s talk about the topic.

According to Wikipedia,

> a troll is a person who sows discord on the Internet by starting arguments or upsetting people, by posting inflammatory,[extraneous][8]{.extiw}, or [off-topic][9]{.mw-redirect} messages in an online community (such as a forum, [chat room][10], or blog) with the deliberate intent of provoking readers into an [emotional][11] response or of otherwise disrupting normal on-topic discussion

Yea it&#8217;s Wikipedia, and the are damn right cause they are always right with all the strict editors that keep off invalid information. However, trolls do not always annoy. Instead, some trolls spice up forums and chat rooms they&#8217;re on. I spend a lot of time on the IRC and even though I will tell you I&#8217;m not much of a troll, I enjoy other trolls and I feed them because I don&#8217;t believe in this

[<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-42" src="http://josephrex.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/5227997213d7b-1024x585.jpg" alt="5227997213d7b" width="474" height="270" />][12]Even if I fall on the trolling side, I get so apologetic like

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-43" src="http://josephrex.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/29270347.jpg" alt="29270347" width="400" height="400" />][13]That&#8217;s majorly because sometimes you get a lot of hates for trolling or you get trolled by a master of trolls.

Memes help make trolling a lot easier. I&#8217;ve been in position of training students in some IT fields. I also find it easier and interesting to use memes for some illustration. They just explain it the way you want it. Imagine how often <a href="http://xkcd.com" target="_blank">XKCD</a> images have been used in various papers.

I like this especially

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-44" src="http://josephrex.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/duty_calls.png" alt="duty_calls" width="300" height="330" />][14]You can find it on <a href="https://xkcd.com/386/" target="_blank">https://xkcd.com/386/</a>

Wikipedia defines memes as

> A meme is an idea, style or action which spreads, often as mimicry, from person to person via the [Internet][15], as with imitating the concept

imitating concept right![<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46" src="http://josephrex.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/funny-barack-michelle-obama-face.jpg" alt="funny-barack-michelle-obama-face" width="540" height="376" />][16]When I read about this meme on <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com" target="_blank">knowyourmeme.com</a> I saw the true story behind this meme and it was imitated[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45" src="http://josephrex.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/notbad.jpg" alt="notbad" width="288" height="288" />][17]Also on Wikipedia, it was written that

> An Internet meme may take the form of an [image][18], [hyperlink][19], [video][20], [picture][21]{.mw-redirect}, [website][22], or [hashtag][23]

In most cases I make use of images. There are really nice video memes on <a href="https://youtube.com" target="_blank">YouTube</a> and <a href="http://9gag.tv" target="_blank">9gag.tv</a>. The parodies on YouTube are examples of awesome trolling  


Now Gifs. Oh awesome gifs. I wouldn&#8217;t put much gifs here but we all know how awesome gifs are.

#### Rules of Memes and Trolls

If you are using a meme, it must be well used at the right time. I&#8217;ve seen a lot of people misuse some memes and that just kills the whole purpose of memes.

Trolls may get boring some times. If you have been known to be good at trolling, and then you notice you&#8217;re getting boring at some point, just drop the gun. Don&#8217;t try to be a total jerk. It sucks.

If you find trolling interesting and you want to explore the art of trolling, I found this awesome article <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Be-a-Troll" target="_blank">http://www.wikihow.com/Be-a-Troll</a> and this video from DEFCON 19 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHqGV5WjS4w" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHqGV5WjS4w</a> . You should also spend more time on websites like [9gag.com][26] and [4chan.org][27] to get the best of these things[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56" src="http://josephrex.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/10154211_507025716070128_7647247148981253641_n.jpg" alt="10154211_507025716070128_7647247148981253641_n" width="640" height="640" />][28]

Happy trollingÂ  <img src="http://josephrex.me/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
