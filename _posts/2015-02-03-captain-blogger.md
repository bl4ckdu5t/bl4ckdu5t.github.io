Someone once told me to have a purpose for everything I do. I believe that even out of our subconscious, everything we do as humans is for a purpose. [Marla Gibbs][1] quotes that:

> I truly believe that everything that we do and everyone that we meet is put in our path for a purpose. There are no accidents; we're all teachers - if we're willing to pay attention to the lessons we learn, trust our positive instincts and not be afraid to take risks or wait for some miracle to come knocking at our door.<br>
  ~ Marla Gibbs

I started blogging in 2011 because of my passion for technologies. My first blog (rexcorpcyber.net) was about offensive cyber security because I was a skiddie with a unidirectional thinking. I thought being a hacker was about breaking into things and I chose the dark path. With time, I found a need to acquire more skills to achieve complex intrusions and then I picked up books on algorithms and programming.

I gained a partial online presence by blogging on how to do things. At this time, I only saw blogging as a thing to do because I enjoyed it. I had no ads at all on the blog because most ad sellers wouldn't give a blog with illegal content a chance to publish ads for them. What I did with some other amateur bloggers was to feature on their blogs by re-writing what has already been written on my blog. They do same with me and even as we cared about SEO, we never knew we were ruining our SEO reputation by having the same content across multiple sites. I'd thought if I could have another blog come and reblog his posts on my blog, then for the bigger blogs that wouldn't do such, I could just copy their blog posts into my site.

I started writing for [infosec institute][2] and part of the agreement stated:

> 
  * Do not post plagiarized content
  * Do not repost your posts from here to your personal blogs until after month

It was until then I could take some time to reason that it was totally useless to have one exactly same content on multiple parts of the content. Even I had written a featured post for another blog or for a company, the best I can do is reference is with a link. Also, I understood copyright policies and the creative commons license. I read about plagiarizations and knew I had been doing it wrong. This made me abandon my old ship (blog). I closed down rexcorpcyber.net and ended the blogging part of my life. At this point, I've put my computing into better use by building software and applications for start-ups and companies. I learnt deeper concepts of security and applied them in securing my client applications.

About 8 months later, I became what you call a full-time programmer and it has been a part of me to surf the web always and find ways I can improve myself. Then I came across [Joerg Mueller][3]'s blog post on [Why all programmers should blog][4]. That gave me a 20% conviction to pick up my old blogging habits again. I'm so stubborn and skeptical that I can hardly be convinced. I started watching the Star Trek series again in 2014 and I noticed captain Kirk had his log where he logged his experiences. If you saw Star Trek then this sounds familiar

> Captain's log, stardate 41153.7. Our destination is planet Deneb IV..

James Kirk kept log of his experiences and destinations as a Captain of the Enterprise. Now I'm my own captain of programming in my programming adventure and I think as a software developer, it is essential that I keep logs as well. Blogs were coined from web logs. Our technology age provides the internet for us to share our logs with everyone and that's just what my blog is about.

I'll point out some major reasons why I still blog today.

* To keep a record of what I've done and how I successfully implemented something programmatically
* To help others who may have the same problem find an easy solution
* To keep myself busy with something interesting

Keeping records from my first point does not include bookmarking. [Scott Hanselman][5] pointed this in his blog post about [keeping your blog from sucking][6]. I learnt from that post that if I come across a post I like, I should make use of <delicious.com> and rather make my blog posts on interesting things which I'll rather call **heroin content**.

I started this blog on WordPress because it is a very easy platform for blogging but this year I moved it to Jekyll. It doesn't matter what platform you may be on, blogging is one essential part of you if you're exploring anything at all (not just software development).
