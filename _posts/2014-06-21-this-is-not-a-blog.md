While exploring the internet like I always do, I found an article titled [&#8220;A blog without comments is not a blog&#8221;][1] by [Jeff Artwood][2] a months ago. Then I said to myself, this is exactly what I&#8217;ve been doing and probably what I will keep doing for a while.

I wasn&#8217;t like this <img src="http://josephrex.me/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" /> . I feel like one of the cigarette guys that hate smoking but can&#8217;t help it. At this point, I&#8217;m pre-occupied with a lot of things and I can&#8217;t handle moderating comments by spammers.

While I ran my former blog &#8220;rexcorpcyber.net&#8221;, I saw less of these spams but now it&#8217;s a big headache for me to deal with. I&#8217;ve taught of strategies to overcome this and I&#8217;ve also decided to stop using wordpress but I&#8217;ve just been to busy + partially lazy to do the right things. Jeff wasn&#8217;t totally correct but I believe he&#8217;s just one of those guys that have fallacies of hasty generalizations (or maybe not). Yes! Maybe not becauseÂ I can recall he also said something like

> &#8216;Despite what I&#8217;ve said, some blogs really shouldn&#8217;t have comments&#8217;.

I think he should have said

> Blogs without comments are evil <img src="http://josephrex.me/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" />

I can&#8217;t have comments on my blog now because I&#8217;m too lazy to moderate, and since I chose to leave my current platform (wordpress) I don&#8217;t want to worry about carrying a database of comments from here to the new platform I&#8217;ll be moving to.

Those are genuine reasons to not have comments I guess. If you really want to give me a reply, you can send me a tweet @joerex101 or create a response blog post on your blog <img src="http://josephrex.me/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" />
