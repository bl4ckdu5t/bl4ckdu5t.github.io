Everyone that comes around me notices that I always emphasize on building stuff for the future. I've worked with start-ups and I'm working with one. I love the fact that involving in most of the projects I've contributed to has built my development skills. What I'm not satisfied with is that we keep iterating development of pre-existing solutions. I believe programming and hackery is about providing solutions that do not exist to problems that are pending. This is why I may not be so pleased and satisfied with sticking to just these. I love Google and the way they always try not to be in a competition by creating things that hasn't pre-existed. [This post][2] from the [IEEE spectrum][3] shows how emotional monitoring devices may be implemented. The researchers at [KAIST (Korean Advanced Institute of Technology)][4] had developed a polymer sensor called PEDOT:PSS which detects goose bumps. For those with a good knowledge of human health, you are aware that these things are usually as a result of stress, tension, and some other depressing emotional states.

More details on the KAIST research is on [this paper][5].

This is the future and I'll like to be a part of its development.
