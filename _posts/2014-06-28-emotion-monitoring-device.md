Everyone that comes around me notices that I always emphasize on building stuff for the future. I&#8217;ve worked with start-ups and I&#8217;m working with one. I love the fact that involving in most of the projects I&#8217;ve contributed to has built my development skills. What I&#8217;m not satisfied with is that we keep iterating development of pre-existing solutions. I believe programming and hackery is about providing solutions that do not exist to problems that are pending. This is why I may not be so pleased and satisfied with sticking to just these. I love Google and the way they always try not to be in a competition by creating things that hasn&#8217;t pre-existed. [This post][2] from the [IEEE spectrum][3] shows how emotional monitoring devices may be implemented. The researchers at [KAIST (Korean Advanced Institute of Technology)][4] had developed a polymer sensor called PEDOT:PSS which detects goose bumps. For those with a good knowledge of human health, you are aware that these things are usually as a result of stress, tension, and some other depressing emotional states.

More details on the KAIST research is on [this paper][5].

This is the future and I&#8217;ll like to be a part of its development.
