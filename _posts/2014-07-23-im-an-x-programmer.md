All things programming is a part of hackery to me. I love to hack stuffs and that&#8217;s what has pulled me into the planet of development and engineering. From my observation, some people miss the point on what programming is about.

Some see it as a tag to their beings like &#8220;Jake the Java Programmer&#8221;. What&#8217;s that? It doesn&#8217;t look reasonable to me. Not because I&#8217;m not a Java programmer but because it just isn&#8217;t right.

Well, Someone could call me a Python programmer because I love writing stuffs in Python or a PHP programmer because PHP is what they see me do most often. However, I wouldn&#8217;t tag myself with any of those because my objective as a programmer is not just to get lauded with a programming language but to create solutions.

If we&#8217;re creating solutions then we can&#8217;t be stuck with a tool. The [SEALS][1] use guns and grenades but when all that&#8217;s left is wood, they use it to defeat their enemies.

Why can&#8217;t all programmers think this way? You shouldn&#8217;t get so obsessed with a language that you want to tag yourself with it alone for the rest of your life.

I&#8217;m a good Python programmer and a better PHP developer. I also started working with Ruby lately and I&#8217;ve been able to play around with Rails.

According to [Google philosophy][2], it&#8217;s best to do one thing really well. I am in total compliance to this. However, doing one thing really well doesn&#8217;t mean you should be stuck to that one thing. Google is popularly known as a search engine and they are the best at it. They go as far as providing search maps and a lot of search filters. But they are not stuck to this. Google also owns gPlus, they own YouTube, they own Android, they recently released a prototype for a Self-driving Car.

Do not misinterpret the message! Be good at what you do, but learn to do other things and do not be stuck on one.
