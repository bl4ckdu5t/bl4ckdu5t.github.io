I have always loved consoles. I can&#8217;t do without them as they make life easy for me in so many ways. I talked about [fish and butterfly in an old blog post ][1]as I use them often. I also use the awesome <a href="http://phpsh.org/" target="_blank">phpsh</a> because it is the best way for me to test php code on the go.

Here we are on laravel and I find myself wanting to test some laravel stuffs especially because I am not presently working on any laravel projects and I do not want to have to set up views and controllers to do stuffs. If unlike me, you are on a laravel project, I think you will still find this very useful as you wouldn&#8217;t have to always go through creating routes or controllers to view expected outputs of code you are testing.

The laravel console is on <a href="https://github.com/darsain/laravel-console" target="_blank">this github repository</a>Â and the image above this post is an example of my usage of the console within my firefox dev browser.
