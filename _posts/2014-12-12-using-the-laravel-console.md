I have always loved consoles. I can't do without them as they make life easy for me in so many ways. I talked about [fish and butterfly in an old blog post ][1]as I use them often. I also use the awesome <a href="http://phpsh.org/" target="_blank">phpsh</a> because it is the best way for me to test php code on the go.

Here we are on laravel and I find myself wanting to test some laravel stuffs especially because I am not presently working on any laravel projects and I do not want to have to set up views and controllers to do stuffs. If unlike me, you are on a laravel project, I think you will still find this very useful as you wouldn't have to always go through creating routes or controllers to view expected outputs of code you are testing.

The laravel console is on <a href="https://github.com/darsain/laravel-console" target="_blank">this github repository</a>Â and the image above this post is an example of my usage of the console within my firefox dev browser.
