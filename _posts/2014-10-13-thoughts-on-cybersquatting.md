I have never been a cyber-squatter and I don&#8217;t plan on becoming one as I have better dreams and goals to achieve. I&#8217;m way to busy for that. Although, I know it does fetch a lot of money if lucky but still I don&#8217;t see it as a right thing to do.

What is cyber squatting?

Squatting in itself means occupying an abandoned area. It is also known as domain squatting. Wikipedia describes it this way:

> **Cybersquatting** (also known as **domain squatting**), according to the United States federal law known as the [Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act][3], is registering, trafficking in, or using a [domain name][4] with [bad faith][5] intent to profit from the goodwill of a [trademark][6] belonging to someone else. The cybersquatter then offers to sell the domain to the person or company who owns a trademark contained within the name at an inflated price.

Here&#8217;s what a domain owned by a cyber squatter looks like:

Oh darn! The whitehouse? Oh yea they got the white house.

I think the guys that do these things are really smart. They see potentials of a domain being put to use in the future and they grab it so fast. Let&#8217;s say my name is John Doe and I suddenly become a big rap star. Some squatting fellas will make a fast move to buy domains like johndoe.com, johndoe.us, johndoe.info, johndoe.biz, johndoe.net, johndoe.org and as much as they can.

As some point I feel I need a domain like other my other celebrity friends and I see that all my name domains have been purchased and are available for purchase at an extremely steep price.

**What&#8217;s my problem with this?**

Like I said I&#8217;m not a squatter but at the same time I don&#8217;t think this should be taken illegal in any way. These guys didn&#8217;t steal what didn&#8217;t belong to them. They simply purchased something before the intended owners and for no reason should it be a crime. I&#8217;m aware the United States, Australia, and Canada take civil actions against people that involve in this.

I don&#8217;t like to break the rules but at the same time I love to share my opinions. There is nothing illegal about domain squatting. It&#8217;s only a smarter move by the squatters. If you find potential in yourself then get your domain soon enough. We are all running horse necks on the internet. It&#8217;s a battle, a market, a competition. Whoever gets it first owns it and has the right to it. They are known cases of cyber squatting which I&#8217;ll list below:

  * Jethro Tull
  * Madonna
  * Primedia Magazine Finance Inc. (Tiger Beat) vs Next Level Productions (Benny Doro)<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"></sup>
  * People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals v. Doughney
  * Lamparello v. Falwell
  * Lufthansa v. Future Media Architects
  * The White House against Whitehouse.com and Whitehouse.org

I&#8217;ll love to get opinions of others on this. You can drop yours in the comments
