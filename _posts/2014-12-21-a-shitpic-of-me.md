For a long time I&#8217;ve been known with the avatar face of me above, having a stamp of my IRC handle (bl4ckdu5t) at the top right. Recently, I found a picture of someone that had tried to steal my identity in some way or thought he was being a good protege by copying me which I don&#8217;t appreciate. He had this version of my avatar

A quote I particularly love from the post is

> Let&#8217;s call them shitpic because they look like shit

This image is an example of a shitpic. According to <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" target="_blank">Steve Jobs on wikiquotes</a>,

> Good artists copy, great artists steal

When you copy, you have a replicated versionÂ of the original item. Meaning you have something that is neither better nor worse than what the original was. On the other hand, when you steal, you take possession of the item totally from the owner. At that point, the owner no longer has it.

What Steve Jobs was insinuating by &#8220;great artists steal&#8221; is not an actual art of stealing but making something more creative and better than what you have copied from. More quality, more value, more importance. This shitpic has not achieved any of these. Well, it&#8217;s a shitpic and I didn&#8217;t expect much from it.

I went ahead to grab some more meta data from the image. The shitpic had been resized and set with a high contrast making it of a lesser quality.
