After reading this [rebuttal][1] to Jeffrey Zeldman's [Kiss my classname][2] what came up on my mind is I think everyone's doing this wrong. This is the main problem with the industry. Impatience to accept and learn why opinions that differ from yours could be relevant. I'd agree with [Thierry Koblentz][3] for the most part as he doesn't totally dismiss what others consider the right way.

Semantic styling does have its good usecases but it doesn't mean visual styling should be ditched. While I'd agree that the [ C in CSS doesn't mean Component][3], I find using a component based SoC to be great as most of our web apps structure are components anyway ( *filters*, *buttons*, *accordions*)
