Besides the beautiful name, houdini would be a great addition to web technologies when eventually implemented by browsers. Before going into what it is exactly, you can think of it as the [babel][1] of CSS. Each time I come across the name Houdini, I imagine Agent Phil Coulson saying _"tahiti, it's a magical place"_.

<figcaption>Houdini, It's a beautiful place. You should go there sometime</figcaption>
</figure>

The objective of the CSS houdini is to create an extendable CSS.
