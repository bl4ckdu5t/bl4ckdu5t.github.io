The common saying is "The walls have ears". This is a figurative expression that expresses that things we say can be heard by people around even while we think there's no one around (or information just leaks in one way or another). Technology in this generation has caused a lot of transformations and changed the way we see things.

The more technologies, the more paranoia. How long can we stay secure. How sure are you that your 48 bit password secured machine doesn't send logs to the NSA? This is even out of the context.

The technologies around now have converted what used to be figurative expressions into literal expressions. If I say "The walls have ears" today, then they have ears (could be through a listening device like cameras, recorders). That's even safe because you can take good enough precautions to check your surroundings for such devices before having confidential conversations.

With <a href="http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2014/algorithm-recovers-speech-from-vibrations-0804" target="_blank">MIT research</a>, audio can be retrieved from visuals. A listening device doesn't have to be present for your conversation to be logged. The chips you left on your table can keep logs of your conversation.

How? From the research, an algorithm was developed to analyze minute vibrations from the visual. This could be a mute video of an event, a distant CCTV, or more.

From the <a href="http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2014/algorithm-recovers-speech-from-vibrations-0804" target="_blank">MIT News</a>:

> <span style="color: #222222;">“When sound hits an object, it causes the object to vibrate,” says Abe Davis, a graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science at MIT and first author on the new paper. “The motion of this vibration creates a very subtle visual signal that’s usually invisible to the naked eye. People didn’t realize that this information was there.”</span>

This is a video demonstration of this:
